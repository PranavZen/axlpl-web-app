# Edit Shipment Page Implementation Summary

## âœ… **COMPLETED: Edit Shipment Page for Active Shipments**

A complete edit shipment page has been created that mirrors the add shipment page but is specifically designed for editing active shipments only.

### **Route Created**
- **URL**: `/edit-shipment/:shipmentId`
- **Example**: `/edit-shipment/SHP123456`
- **Access**: Protected route (requires authentication)

### **Key Features**

#### 1. **Shipment Status Validation**
- âœ… Only **active/approved** shipments can be edited
- âœ… Automatic validation on page load
- âœ… Redirects to shipments list if shipment is not active
- âœ… User-friendly error messages

#### 2. **Multi-Step Form (Same as Add Shipment)**
- âœ… **Step 1**: Shipment Details (weight, category, payment mode, etc.)
- âœ… **Step 2**: Address Information (sender/receiver details)
- âœ… **Step 3**: Delivery Options (different delivery address)
- âœ… **Step 4**: Review & Confirm (final review and update)

#### 3. **Data Pre-population**
- âœ… Fetches existing shipment data by ID
- âœ… Pre-fills all form fields with current values
- âœ… Maintains form state across steps
- âœ… Loading states while fetching data

#### 4. **Enhanced Navigation**
- âœ… Edit button in shipments table navigates to edit page
- âœ… Status validation before allowing edit
- âœ… Back navigation to shipments list
- âœ… Form navigation between steps

### **Implementation Details**

#### **Files Created/Modified**

1. **`src/pages/EditShipment.tsx`** - Main edit page component
2. **`src/redux/slices/editShipmentSlice.ts`** - Redux slice for edit functionality
3. **`src/redux/store.ts`** - Added editShipment reducer
4. **`src/App.tsx`** - Added edit shipment route
5. **`src/pages/ShipmentsPage.tsx`** - Updated edit handler
6. **`src/components/pagecomponents/addshipmentpage/FormNavigation.tsx`** - Added custom submit text

#### **Redux State Management**

```typescript
// Edit Shipment Slice
interface EditShipmentState {
  shipment: any | null;
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}

// Actions
- fetchShipmentById(shipmentId) // Fetch shipment data
- updateShipment({ shipmentId, shipmentData }) // Update shipment
- clearShipment() // Clear current shipment
- clearError() // Clear errors
```

#### **API Integration**

```typescript
// Fetch shipment details
POST /getShipmentDetails
{
  shipment_id: string,
  user_id: string
}

// Update shipment
POST /updateShipment
{
  shipment_id: string,
  user_id: string,
  ...shipmentData
}
```

### **User Flow**

1. **Access Edit Page**:
   - User clicks "Edit" button in shipments table
   - System validates shipment status (must be active/approved)
   - Navigates to `/edit-shipment/:shipmentId`

2. **Load Shipment Data**:
   - Fetches shipment details by ID
   - Pre-populates all form fields
   - Shows loading state during fetch

3. **Edit Process**:
   - User navigates through 4 steps (same as add shipment)
   - Form validation on each step
   - Data persisted across steps

4. **Submit Changes**:
   - Final step shows "Update Shipment" button
   - Calls update API with modified data
   - Shows success/error messages
   - Redirects back to shipments list

### **Enhanced Shipments Table Integration**

The shipments table edit button now:

```typescript
const handleEditShipment = (shipment: any) => {
  // Validate shipment status
  if (shipment.shipment_status?.toLowerCase() !== 'approved') {
    alert('Only active shipments can be edited');
    return;
  }
  
  // Navigate to edit page
  navigate(`/edit-shipment/${shipment.shipment_id}`);
};
```

### **Error Handling**

- âœ… **Loading States**: Shows spinner while fetching data
- âœ… **Error States**: Displays error messages with retry options
- âœ… **Not Found**: Handles missing shipments gracefully
- âœ… **Status Validation**: Prevents editing non-active shipments
- âœ… **API Errors**: User-friendly error messages

### **Form Validation**

Same validation as add shipment:
- âœ… Required field validation
- âœ… Format validation (email, phone, etc.)
- âœ… Business logic validation
- âœ… Step-by-step validation

### **Testing the Feature**

1. **Navigate to Active Shipments**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3001/shipments/approved
   ```

2. **Click Edit Button** on any active shipment

3. **Verify Edit Page**:
   - URL should be `/edit-shipment/SHIPMENT_ID`
   - Form should be pre-filled with existing data
   - Header should show "Edit Shipment #SHIPMENT_ID"

4. **Test Validation**:
   - Try editing non-active shipments (should show error)
   - Test form validation on each step
   - Test successful update flow

### **Security & Permissions**

- âœ… **Protected Route**: Requires authentication
- âœ… **Status Validation**: Only active shipments editable
- âœ… **User Validation**: Only owner can edit their shipments
- âœ… **Token Authentication**: All API calls use bearer token

### **Future Enhancements**

Potential improvements:
- **Audit Trail**: Track who edited what and when
- **Partial Updates**: Only send changed fields to API
- **Real-time Validation**: Validate data against business rules
- **Draft Saving**: Save progress without submitting
- **Approval Workflow**: Require approval for certain changes

The edit shipment functionality is now fully integrated and provides a seamless editing experience for active shipments! ðŸŽ‰
