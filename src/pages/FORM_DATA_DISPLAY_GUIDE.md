# Edit Shipment Form Data Display Guide

## ✅ **ENHANCED: Form Data Display with Comprehensive Debugging**

The edit shipment form has been enhanced to properly display shipment data in form fields with extensive debugging capabilities.

## 🔧 **Key Improvements Made**

### **1. Enhanced Data Mapping Function**
```typescript
const getInitialValues = () => {
  if (!shipment) {
    return { /* empty form values */ };
  }

  // Comprehensive field mapping with fallbacks
  return {
    name: shipment.sender_company_name || "",
    senderCompanyName: shipment.sender_company_name || "",
    receiverCompanyName: shipment.receiver_company_name || "",
    senderGstNo: shipment.sender_gst_no || "",
    receiverGstNo: shipment.receiver_gst_no || "",
    senderArea: shipment.sender_area || shipment.sender_areaname || null,
    receiverArea: shipment.receiver_area || shipment.receiver_areaname || null,
    // ... comprehensive mapping for all fields
  };
};
```

### **2. Formik Re-initialization**
- ✅ Added `key` prop to force re-initialization when shipment changes
- ✅ Enhanced `enableReinitialize={true}` for dynamic updates
- ✅ Proper loading state management

### **3. Comprehensive Debug Panel**
- ✅ **Status Indicators**: Shows data availability, loading state, errors
- ✅ **Form Values Preview**: Displays key form field values
- ✅ **Raw Data Inspector**: Shows all available shipment fields
- ✅ **Field Mapping Verification**: Compare API fields to form fields

### **4. Test Data Population**
- ✅ **Test Button**: Manually populate form with test data
- ✅ **Field Verification**: Test individual field updates
- ✅ **Data Flow Testing**: Verify form responds to data changes

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### **Step 1: Access Edit Page**
1. Navigate to Active Shipments: `http://localhost:3001/shipments/approved`
2. Click "Edit" button on any active shipment
3. Should navigate to: `/edit-shipment/SHIPMENT_ID`

### **Step 2: Check Debug Panel**
Look for the debug panel at the top of the form:

```
🔍 Debug Info:
✅ Shipment ID: SHP123456
✅ Shipment Data Available: Yes
✅ Loading: No
✅ Error: None

📝 Form Values Preview:
• Name: Test Company Ltd
• Sender Company: Test Company Ltd
• Receiver Company: Receiver Corp
• Sender GST: 27ABCDE1234F1Z5
• Receiver GST: 07FGHIJ5678K2L9
```

### **Step 3: Inspect Raw Data**
1. Click "📊 Raw Shipment Data (Click to expand)"
2. Review "Available Fields" to see all API data
3. Click "Full JSON Data" to see complete shipment object
4. Verify field names match your expectations

### **Step 4: Test Form Population**
1. Click "🧪 Populate Test Data" button (development mode only)
2. Verify form fields update with test data
3. Navigate between form steps to check all sections

### **Step 5: Check Console Logs**
Open browser console and look for:
```
Shipment data received: {...}
Shipment fields: [array of field names]
Current form values: {...}
Shipment data in form: {...}
```

## 🔍 **Debugging Checklist**

### **✅ Data Availability**
- [ ] Debug panel shows "Shipment Data Available: Yes"
- [ ] Raw shipment data contains expected fields
- [ ] Console logs show shipment data received

### **✅ Form Field Mapping**
- [ ] Form Values Preview shows populated values
- [ ] Key fields like company names and GST numbers are filled
- [ ] Area fields show proper values (check for object vs string)

### **✅ Form Functionality**
- [ ] Test data button populates fields successfully
- [ ] Form validation works on each step
- [ ] Navigation between steps preserves data

### **✅ Data Flow**
- [ ] Clicking edit from shipments table passes data correctly
- [ ] Direct URL access fetches data via API
- [ ] Form re-initializes when shipment data changes

## 🐛 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: Form Fields Still Empty**
**Symptoms**: Debug panel shows data available but form fields empty
**Solution**: Check field mapping in `getInitialValues()` function

### **Issue 2: Some Fields Populated, Others Empty**
**Symptoms**: Basic fields work but complex fields (dropdowns, areas) don't
**Solution**: Check if API returns objects vs strings for dropdown fields

### **Issue 3: Data Available but Not Displaying**
**Symptoms**: Debug panel shows data but form doesn't update
**Solution**: Check Formik `key` prop and `enableReinitialize`

### **Issue 4: Test Button Doesn't Work**
**Symptoms**: Clicking test button doesn't populate fields
**Solution**: Check if `setFieldValue` function is working correctly

## 📊 **Field Mapping Reference**

| Form Field | API Field(s) | Fallback |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| `name` | `sender_company_name` | - |
| `senderCompanyName` | `sender_company_name` | - |
| `receiverCompanyName` | `receiver_company_name` | - |
| `senderGstNo` | `sender_gst_no` | - |
| `receiverGstNo` | `receiver_gst_no` | - |
| `senderCity` | `sender_city` | `origin` |
| `receiverCity` | `receiver_city` | `destination` |
| `senderArea` | `sender_area` | `sender_areaname` |
| `receiverArea` | `receiver_area` | `receiver_areaname` |
| `pickupDate` | `pickup_date` | `created_date` |

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

After implementing these changes, you should see:

1. **✅ Immediate Data Display**: Form fields populated when coming from shipments table
2. **✅ Comprehensive Debugging**: Detailed debug panel showing all data flow
3. **✅ Test Capabilities**: Ability to manually test form population
4. **✅ Error Handling**: Clear error messages when data is missing
5. **✅ Console Logging**: Detailed logs for troubleshooting

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Test the enhanced form** using the steps above
2. **Verify field mapping** matches your API response structure
3. **Check specific fields** that are important for your use case
4. **Remove debug features** once everything is working correctly
5. **Optimize performance** by removing unnecessary console logs

The form should now properly display shipment data with comprehensive debugging to help identify any remaining issues! 🎉
