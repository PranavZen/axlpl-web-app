The `ShipmentsPage.tsx` component now includes both **checkbox** and **action** columns for all shipment status pages:

### **Pages Enhanced**
- `/shipments/pending` - Pending Shipments
- `/shipments/approved` - Approved Shipments  
- `/shipments/hold` - Hold Shipments
- `/shipments/archived` - Archived Shipments

### **New Features Added**

- ✅ "Select All" functionality in header
- ✅ Tracks selected shipments across all status pages

#### 2. **Actions Column** (Last Column)
- ✅ **View Button**: Opens modal with all shipment details
- ✅ **Edit Button**: Triggers edit functionality (currently shows alert)
- ✅ **Delete Button**: Shows confirmation and deletes shipment

#### 3. **Bulk Actions Section**
- ✅ Shows count of selected shipments
- ✅ Lists selected shipment IDs and routes
- ✅ **Export Selected**: Export functionality for selected shipments
- ✅ **Update Status**: Bulk status update for selected shipments
- ✅ **Delete Selected**: Bulk delete functionality

### **Implementation Details**

```tsx
// Enhanced ShipmentsPage with both features
<Table
  columns={tableColumns}
  data={filteredShipments}
  sectionTitle={statusTitleMap[shipment_status || ""] || "Active Shipments"}
  enableRowSelection={true}           // ← Checkbox column
  selectedRows={selectedShipments}    // ← Selection state
  onRowSelectionChange={handleShipmentSelectionChange}
  rowActions={{                       // ← Actions column
    onEdit: handleEditShipment,
    onDelete: handleDeleteShipment,
    onView: handleViewShipment
  }}
  rowIdAccessor="shipment_id"         // ← Unique identifier
/>
```

### **Bulk Actions Available**

When shipments are selected, users can:

1. **Export Selected** - Export selected shipments to file
2. **Update Status** - Bulk status change for selected shipments
3. **Delete Selected** - Bulk delete selected shipments

### **Action Handlers**

```tsx
// View shipment details (automatic modal)
const handleViewShipment = (shipment) => {
  // Modal opens automatically with all shipment data
};

// Edit shipment (customize as needed)
const handleEditShipment = (shipment) => {
  // Navigate to edit page or open edit modal
  alert(`Edit shipment: ${shipment.shipment_id}`);
};

// Delete shipment (with confirmation)
const handleDeleteShipment = (shipment) => {
  if (confirm(`Delete shipment ${shipment.shipment_id}?`)) {
    // Call delete API
  }
};
```

### **Data Structure**

The table displays these shipment fields:
- Date (created_date)
- Shipment ID (shipment_id) 
- Sender (sender_company_name)
- Receiver (receiver_company_name)
- Origin & Destination
- Sender & Receiver Areas
- GST Numbers
- Status (shipment_status)

### **Status Filtering**

The component automatically filters shipments based on URL parameter:
- `/shipments/pending` → Shows only pending shipments
- `/shipments/approved` → Shows only approved shipments
- `/shipments/hold` → Shows only hold shipments
- `/shipments/archived` → Shows only archived shipments

### **Testing the Enhancement**

1. Navigate to any shipment status page:
   - http://localhost:3001/shipments/pending
   - http://localhost:3001/shipments/approved
   - http://localhost:3001/shipments/hold
   - http://localhost:3001/shipments/archived

2. You should see:
   - ✅ Checkbox column as first column
   - ✅ Actions column as last column
   - ✅ Bulk actions section when shipments are selected
   - ✅ View modal when clicking "View" button

### **Customization Options**

You can easily customize the actions by modifying the handlers:

```tsx
// Example: Navigate to edit page instead of alert
const handleEditShipment = (shipment) => {
  navigate(`/edit-shipment/${shipment.shipment_id}`);
};

// Example: Call actual delete API
const handleDeleteShipment = async (shipment) => {
  if (confirm(`Delete shipment ${shipment.shipment_id}?`)) {
    await dispatch(deleteShipment(shipment.shipment_id));
    // Refresh data
  }
};
```

All shipment status pages now have consistent, enhanced functionality with both selection and action capabilities!
