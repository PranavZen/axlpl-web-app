# Edit Shipment Form Field Display Fix

## ✅ **FIXED: Shipment Data Now Displays in Form Input Fields**

The edit shipment form has been cleaned up and fixed to properly display shipment data in the actual input fields.

## 🔧 **Key Changes Made**

### **1. Removed All Debug Panels**
- ✅ Removed debug info panel
- ✅ Removed real-time form values display
- ✅ Removed test buttons
- ✅ Removed console logging
- ✅ Clean, production-ready interface

### **2. Fixed Form Initialization**

## 📋 **Field Mapping**

The form now properly maps shipment data to form fields:

```typescript
const initialValues = {
  // Step 1: Shipment Details
  name: shipment?.sender_company_name || "",
  senderCompanyName: shipment?.sender_company_name || "",
  receiverCompanyName: shipment?.receiver_company_name || "",
  netWeight: shipment?.net_weight || shipment?.weight || "",
  grossWeight: shipment?.gross_weight || "",
  numberOfParcel: shipment?.number_of_parcel || "1",
  invoiceValue: shipment?.invoice_value || "",
  
  // Step 2: Address Information
  senderGstNo: shipment?.sender_gst_no || "",
  receiverGstNo: shipment?.receiver_gst_no || "",
  senderCity: shipment?.sender_city || shipment?.origin || "",
  receiverCity: shipment?.receiver_city || shipment?.destination || "",
  senderMobile: shipment?.sender_mobile || "",
  receiverMobile: shipment?.receiver_mobile || "",
  senderEmail: shipment?.sender_email || "",
  receiverEmail: shipment?.receiver_email || "",
  
  // ... all other fields properly mapped
};
```
