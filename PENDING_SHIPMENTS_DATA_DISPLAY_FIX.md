# Pending Shipments Data Display Fix

## ðŸŽ¯ **Issue Identified and Fixed**

**Problem**: After successful shipment insertion, navigation to Pending Shipments page occurred but the new shipment data was not displaying in the table.

**Root Causes**:
1. **Timing Issue**: API refresh was happening too quickly before server processing was complete
2. **Status Mismatch**: Shipment was being created with "Approved" status instead of "Pending"
3. **API Endpoint**: `/shipmentactivelist` might filter out pending shipments
4. **No Immediate UI Feedback**: User had to wait for API refresh to see new data

## âœ… **Comprehensive Solutions Implemented**

### **1. Fixed Shipment Status**
```typescript
// Changed from "Approved" to "Pending"
formData.append("shipment_status", "Pending");
```
- âœ… New shipments now have correct "Pending" status
- âœ… Matches the Pending Shipments page filter

### **2. Immediate UI Feedback**
```typescript
// Add new shipment to Redux store immediately
const newShipmentForStore = {
  shipment_id: shipmentId,
  shipment_status: "Pending",
  sender_company_name: "A.B. GOLD",
  receiver_company_name: "DGLA QUALITY SERVICS PVT. LTD.",
  gross_weight: "546",
  invoice_value: "10000",
  grand_total: "966.42",
  shipment_date: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0],
  created_at: new Date().toISOString(),
};
dispatch(addNewShipment(newShipmentForStore));
```
- âœ… New shipment appears instantly in UI
- âœ… No waiting for API refresh
- âœ… Better user experience

### **3. Multiple Timed Refreshes**
```typescript
// First refresh after 2 seconds
setTimeout(() => {
  dispatch(fetchAllShipments());
  toast.info("Refreshing shipments data...");
  
  // Second refresh after 5 seconds total
  setTimeout(() => {
    dispatch(fetchAllShipments());
    
    // Final refresh after 10 seconds total
    setTimeout(() => {
      dispatch(fetchAllShipments());
      toast.success("Shipments data updated!");
    }, 5000);
  }, 3000);
}, 2000);
```
- âœ… Multiple refresh attempts to ensure data sync
- âœ… Longer delays to allow server processing
- âœ… User feedback during refresh process

### **4. Enhanced ShipmentsPage Auto-Refresh**
```typescript
// Refresh when route/status changes
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("ðŸ“„ ShipmentsPage: Refreshing data for status:", shipment_status);
  dispatch(fetchAllShipments());
}, [dispatch, shipment_status]);
```
- âœ… Automatic refresh when navigating to Pending Shipments
- âœ… Ensures fresh data on page load

### **5. Manual Refresh Button**
```jsx
<button
  className="btn btn-outline-primary btn-sm"
  onClick={handleRefresh}
  disabled={loading}
>
  {loading ? "Refreshing..." : "Refresh"}
</button>
```
- âœ… Users can manually refresh if needed
- âœ… Visual loading state during refresh
- âœ… Fallback option for any timing issues

### **6. Enhanced Debugging**
```typescript
console.log("ðŸ“¡ Fetching shipments from API...");
console.log("ðŸ“¥ Raw API Response:", response.data);
console.log("ðŸ“¦ Extracted shipment data:", shipmentData);
console.log("ðŸ“Š Number of shipments found:", shipmentData.length);
console.log("ðŸ“‹ Shipment statuses:", shipmentData.map(s => ({ 
  id: s.shipment_id, 
  status: s.shipment_status 
})));
```
- âœ… Complete visibility into API responses
- âœ… Track shipment statuses and counts
- âœ… Identify any filtering issues

### **Step 4: Background Data Sync**
1. âœ… First API refresh after 2 seconds
2. âœ… Second API refresh after 5 seconds
