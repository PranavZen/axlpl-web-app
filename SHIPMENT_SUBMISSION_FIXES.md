# Shipment Submission API Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 🐛 **Issue 1: Missing Required Field**
**Problem**: Step 4 validation required `pickupDate` field but it wasn't present in StepFourFormFields component.
**Solution**: Added `pickupDate` and `specialInstructions` fields to Step 4.

### 🐛 **Issue 2: Async Function Not Awaited**
**Problem**: Formik `onSubmit` called `handleSubmit(values)` without awaiting the async function.
**Solution**: Made Formik `onSubmit` async and added `await` before `handleSubmit(values)`.

### 🐛 **Issue 3: Form Validation Blocking Submission**
**Problem**: Form validation was preventing submission due to missing required fields.
**Solution**: Added all required fields to Step 4 form.

## Files Modified

### 1. **StepFourFormFields.tsx**
- ✅ Added `pickupDate` field (required for validation)
- ✅ Added `specialInstructions` field (optional)
- ✅ Added proper form field integration with Formik

### 2. **AddShipement.tsx**
- ✅ Made Formik `onSubmit` async
- ✅ Added `await` before `handleSubmit` call
- ✅ Added comprehensive debugging logs

### 3. **shipmentSlice.ts**
- ✅ Added debugging logs to track API calls
- ✅ Enhanced error handling and logging

## New Step 4 Fields Added

```typescript
// Pickup Date (Required)
<input
  name="pickupDate"
  type="date"
  value={values.pickupDate || ""}
  onChange={(e) => setFieldValue("pickupDate", e.target.value)}
  min={new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]} // Minimum date is today
/>

// Special Instructions (Optional)
<textarea
  name="specialInstructions"
  value={values.specialInstructions || ""}
  onChange={(e) => setFieldValue("specialInstructions", e.target.value)}
  placeholder="Any special handling instructions..."
/>
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. **Navigate to Add Shipment Page**
- Go to the application
- Navigate to "Add Shipment" page

### 2. **Fill Out Multi-Step Form**
- **Step 1**: Fill all required fields (name, category, commodity, weights, etc.)
- **Step 2**: Fill sender and receiver information
- **Step 3**: Fill delivery options (if different delivery address is needed)
- **Step 4**: 
  - Select a pickup date (required)
  - Add special instructions (optional)
  - Verify calculated charges are displayed

### 3. **Submit Shipment**
- Click "Submit Shipment" button
- Check browser console for debugging logs
- Verify API call is made to `insertShipment` endpoint

### 4. **Expected Console Logs**
When you click Submit Shipment, you should see these logs in browser console:

```
📝 Formik onSubmit called - Step: 3 Values: {...}
✅ Last step reached, calling handleSubmit
🚀 handleSubmit called with values: {...}
📤 Dispatching submitShipment...
🔄 submitShipment thunk called with: {...}
🔐 Auth check - Token: true UserId: [user_id]
📋 FormData prepared, making API call to: https://new.axlpl.com/messenger/services_v6/insertShipment
📊 Key form data: {...}
📥 API Response: {...}
📥 submitShipment result: {...}
```

### 5. **Expected Behavior**
- ✅ Loading toast appears: "Submitting shipment..."
- ✅ Submit button shows spinner and "Submitting..." text
- ✅ API call is made to `insertShipment` endpoint
- ✅ Success toast appears with shipment ID (if successful)
- ✅ Form resets and returns to Step 1
- ✅ New shipment appears in Active Shipments table

## Debugging Steps

If the API is still not being called:

### 1. **Check Console Logs**
- Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
- Go to Console tab
- Look for the debugging logs listed above

### 2. **Check Network Tab**
- Go to Network tab in Developer Tools
- Click Submit Shipment
- Look for POST request to `insertShipment`

### 3. **Check Form Validation**
- If no logs appear, form validation might be failing
- Check if all required fields are filled
- Look for validation error messages

### 4. **Check Authentication**
- Verify user is logged in
- Check if token exists in session storage
- Look for "Authentication required" error

## Common Issues and Solutions

### **Issue**: No console logs appear
**Solution**: Form validation is failing. Check all required fields are filled.

### **Issue**: "Authentication required" error
**Solution**: User needs to log in again. Token might be expired.

### **Issue**: API call fails with 400/500 error
**Solution**: Check form data mapping. Some required API fields might be missing.

### **Issue**: Success response but shipment not in Active Shipments
**Solution**: Check if shipment was created with correct status. Refresh Active Shipments page.

## API Data Mapping

The form data is automatically mapped to API requirements:

```typescript
// Form Field → API Field
values.grossWeight → gross_weight
values.category?.value → category_id
values.senderCompanyName → sender_company_name
values.receiverCompanyName → receiver_company_name
values.insurance → axlpl_insurance (1/0)
// ... and 70+ other fields
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the complete flow** with the debugging enabled
2. **Check console logs** to identify where the process stops
3. **Verify API response** and shipment creation
4. **Remove debugging logs** once everything works
5. **Add error handling** for specific API error cases

The shipment submission should now work correctly with proper form validation, async handling, and comprehensive debugging to track any remaining issues.
