# Test Plan for Name Field Fix

## Issue Description
When the Edit Shipment page is reloaded or refreshed, the name field value was being automatically removed and replaced with the logged-in user's customer details, instead of preserving the existing value.

## Root Cause
1. The `name` field was missing from the `initialValues` in `EditShipment.tsx`
2. The `useEffect` in `StepOneFormFields.tsx` was automatically setting the name field with logged-in user data when `!values.name` was true
3. During page refresh, there was a race condition where the name field would be empty, triggering the automatic population

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added name field to EditShipment initialValues
- **File**: `src/pages/EditShipment.tsx`
- **Change**: Added `name: getLoggedInUserName(),` to the initialValues object
- **Reasoning**: Ensures the name field always has a value from the logged-in user (who is currently editing)

### 2. Improved useEffect logic in StepOneFormFields
- **File**: `src/components/pagecomponents/addshipmentpage/StepOneFormFields.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added check for `!values.shipment_id` to distinguish between new and edit modes
  - Added ref to track if default name was already set to prevent multiple overwrites
- **Reasoning**: Prevents automatic name setting during edit mode

### 3. Added getUserData import
- **File**: `src/pages/EditShipment.tsx`
- **Change**: Added import for `getUserData` utility function

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### For New Shipments (AddShipment page):
- Name field should be automatically populated with logged-in user's company name
- Should work as before

### For Edit Shipments (EditShipment page):
- Name field should always show the logged-in user's company name (current editor)
- Should NOT change on page refresh/reload
- Should remain consistent throughout the editing session

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Edit Shipment - Initial Load
1. Navigate to Edit Shipment page
2. Verify name field shows logged-in user's company name
3. ✅ Expected: Name field is populated

### Test Case 2: Edit Shipment - Page Refresh
1. Navigate to Edit Shipment page
2. Note the name field value
3. Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
4. ✅ Expected: Name field retains the same value (logged-in user's company name)

### Test Case 3: New Shipment - Still Works
1. Navigate to Add Shipment page
2. Verify name field is automatically populated
3. ✅ Expected: Name field shows logged-in user's company name

### Test Case 4: Edit Shipment - Different Users
1. Login as User A
2. Create a shipment
3. Login as User B  
4. Edit the shipment created by User A
5. ✅ Expected: Name field shows User B's company name (current editor)

## Files Modified
1. `src/pages/EditShipment.tsx`
2. `src/components/pagecomponents/addshipmentpage/StepOneFormFields.tsx`

## Backwards Compatibility
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ New shipment flow remains unchanged
- ✅ Edit shipment flow now works correctly
